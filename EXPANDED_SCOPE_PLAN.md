# Expanded AutoML System - Full Scope Implementation Plan

## Current Gaps Analysis

### 1. Text Representations (Currently Missing)
- **Pre-trained Word Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText
- **Contextual Embeddings**: Sentence-BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder
- **Advanced Tokenization**: BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece
- **Feature Engineering**: POS tags, named entities, syntactic features
- **Feature Selection**: Chi-square, mutual information, ANOVA

### 2. Model Architectures (Currently Missing)
- **Traditional ML**:
  - SVM with multiple kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial, sigmoid)
  - XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
  - Random Forest, Extra Trees
  - Naive Bayes variants
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Deep Learning**:
  - GRU and BiGRU networks
  - Proper BERT/RoBERTa/ALBERT fine-tuning
  - DeBERTa, ELECTRA, XLNet
  - Hierarchical attention networks
  - TextCNN with multiple filter sizes
- **Hybrid Models**:
  - SVM on top of BERT embeddings
  - XGBoost with deep features
  - Ensemble of traditional and deep models

### 3. Advanced Augmentation (Currently Missing)
- **Back-translation**: Using translation models
- **Paraphrasing**: Using T5 or GPT models
- **Contextual augmentation**: BERT-based word replacement
- **Noise injection**: Character-level, word-level
- **Mixup and manifold mixup** for text

### 4. Fidelity Dimensions (Currently Limited)
- **Sequence length**: Progressive from 50 to full length
- **Vocabulary size**: From 1k to 50k
- **Model complexity**: Layers, hidden dims, attention heads
- **Training data fraction**: Progressive sampling
- **Feature dimensions**: For traditional ML methods

### 5. External Resources (Not Utilized)
- **Pre-trained LMs**: Proper HuggingFace model zoo integration
- **External corpora**: Wikipedia, CommonCrawl for domain adaptation
- **Cross-lingual models**: mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa
- **Domain-specific models**: SciBERT, BioBERT, FinBERT
